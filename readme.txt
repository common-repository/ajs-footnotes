Produces attractive, footnotes that are capable of containing HTML data, like images or links, simply by including them in the text.

== Description ==
This plugin allows an author to include footnotes in text by enclosing the note in doubled parenthesis ((Note.)) When the content is shown to the end user, the notes are removed from the text and included in the style of a footnote. Hovering over the footnote link will displays a popup with the footnotes content. Notes are also gathered and listed at the bottom of the page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I mark a footnote? =
Enclose the text you want to make a note from with double parenthesis. For instance ((This text would be in the note.))

= What does "Escape HTML Entities" do? =
The "Escape HTML Entities" option will cause WordPress to escape the text for the HTML special characters before displaying it. This will turn characters like & into &amp;.This is necessary if your characters are not already escaped. In most cases, this is not the case, as WordPress escapes those characters when they're entered into the system. However, if things aren't working right, you may need to turn this option on.

= I'm seeing strange &'s with letters after where punctuation should beï¿½ =
Turn "Escape HTML Entitees" off. (See above FAQ)
